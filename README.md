# Portfolio
This project is my first attempt at making a mobile responsive website, utilizing the Bootstrap framework. 

The website is responsive at three levels. When the screen's max width is 980px, 768px and 640px, the various elements will hopefully respond accordingly. 

The Navbar begins with a brand header, although there is no image associated with this. Across from this, you will see the navigation links, as well as a pull down link for the various portfolios that I would like to develop for this site. 

Below this area, I have placed a simple Bootstrap card. These cards will also respond to various view-port widths. 

The site is a work in progress, and I not really satisfied with the overall design, but I have been learning a thing or two about responsiveness with this assignment. I am not really into the static picture as a background, but would rather focus on a gradient of some kind. With time, I will learn how to apply these necessary changes.
